Quick Start
===========

   ./configure
   make
   su -c "make install"


Usage
=====
   quotatool [options ... filesystem
   quotatool -u | -g  -t time -i | -r filesystem

The actual arguments accepted depends on your system.  Solaris,
for example, doesn't support group quotas, so the -g option is
useless.   If your getopt() doesn't support optional arguments,
then you always need to pass an argument to -u and -g.


Options
=======
   -b      set block limits
   -i      set inode limits

   -q n    set soft limit to n blocks/inodes
   -l n    set hard limit to n blocks/inodes

   quotatool accepts the units Mb, Kb, bytes and blocks
   to modify limit arguments. See examples below.

   -t      time set global grace period to time.
           The time parameter consists of an optional
           '+' or '-' modifier, a  number, and one of: 
           'sec', 'min', 'hour', 'day', 'week', and 
           'month'.  If a +/- modifier is present, the
           current quota will be increased/reduced by
           the amount specified

   -r      restart grace period for uid or gid

   -h      print a usage message

   -v      verbose mode -- print status messages during execution
           use this twice for even more information

   -n      do everything except set the quota.  useful with -v
           to see what is supposed to happen

   -V      show version


Examples
========

Set soft block limit to 15MB, hard block limit to 20MB for user mpg4 on /home:

   quotatool -u mpg4 -bq 15M -l "20 Mb" /home

Set hard inode limit to 2000 for user johan on /var:

   quotatool -u johan -i -l 2000 /var

Set the global block grace period to one week on /home:

   quotatool -u  -b -t "1 week" /home
   
Restart inode grace period for user johan on root filesystem:

   quotatool -u johan -i -r /


Notes
=====

Grace periods are set on a "global per quotatype and filesystem" basis only.
Each quotatype (usrquota / grpquota) on each filesystem has two grace periods
- one for block limits and one for inode limits.
It is not possible to set different grace periods for users on the same filesystem.


Platforms and Filesystems
=========================

quotatool currently builds and works well on:
-- Linux --
Both old and new quota formats. 
ext2, ext3, ReiserFS and XFS supported

-- Solaris --

-- AIX --
